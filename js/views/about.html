        <p style = "margin-left: 25px;">
          Throughout my 14-year career journey, I've not only excelled in technical roles but also taken on significant managerial responsibilities, despite not holding the formal title of Manager. Here are some highlights of my management experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
           <b> Leadership in Product Management:</b> In April 2015, when the Manager of the Oracle Advanced Benefits product departed, I was entrusted with complete responsibility for the product and was tasked with managing a team of two Applications engineers. Despite being in a <i>Senior Applications Developer</i> role at the time, I stepped up to the challenge, gained in-depth knowledge of the product, and effectively managed both the product and the team.
          </li>
          <li>
           <b> Independent Decision Making:</b> I have consistently demonstrated my ability to make independent decisions regarding the direction and prioritization of work on the products I own. This autonomy has allowed me to drive projects forward and ensure the successful delivery of results.
          </li>
          <li>
           <b> Personnel Management:</b> Throughout my career, I have been responsible for managing at least <i>one person</i>, and at times, I have overseen multiple individuals. At one point, I managed two significant products simultaneously and supervised a team of <i>three people</i>, effectively delegating tasks, providing guidance, and fostering a collaborative work environment.
          </li>
